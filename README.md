MERNjs is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/), [ReactJS](http//facebook.github.io/react/) and [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.

## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MERNjs application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics.
* ReactJS - React's [Official Website](http//facebook.github.io/react/) is a great starting point.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

## Downloading MERNjs
Currently there is a single way you can get the MERNjs boilerplate:

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get MERNjs is to use git to directly clone the MERNjs repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IamMohaiminul/MERNjs MERNjs
```

This will clone the latest version of the MERNjs repository to a **MERNjs** folder.

## Running Your Application
To run your application follow this steps.
###### To install all dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```
###### To start application
```sh
// build the application
$ npm run build

// start the application (without debug mode)
$ npm start
// start the application (with debug mode)
$ npm run debug
```
###### To live changes of application (not for production environment)
```sh
// live changes of client side
$ npm run live:client

// live changes of server side (without debug mode)
$ npm run live:server
// live changes of server side (with debug mode)
$ npm run live:server:debug
```
*Note: Please make sure your MongoDB is running.*

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *default (development)* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) for Client App, [http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin) for Admin App & [http://127.0.0.1:3000/api](http://127.0.0.1:3000/api) for RESTful APIs.
